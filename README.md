## :page_facing_up: What's This?
<p>This is a Java console application, which can read text files, calculate some statistics and save all data into the database. The application uses JDBC as DAO layer implementation.</p>
<p>In current implementation it's possible to calculate longest word, shortest word, line length, quantity of words, quantity of non-space symbols, average word length, words' duplications for each line of the file, and for the whole file.</p>

## :nut_and_bolt: Tech Stack
- Platform: Java EE 8
- Project management tool: Maven
- Database: MySQL 5
- Logging: Log4j

## :rocket: Project Deployment
How to run the application with maven:
1. Install JDK or JRE latest version and set correct JAVA_HOME variable.
2. Install Git (distributed version control system).
3. Install Maven.
4. For your convenience, you can add above-listed applications to PATH system variable, so you will be able to execute them from any folder.
5. Install and configure MySQL database.
   <br />Or you are free to use provided public server 178.136.201.61 with phpMyAdmin for testing purpose
   <br />(for your convenience all connection data are hardcoded). 
6. Run bundled init_db.sql file in your database to initialize it. This step is already done for provided MySQL server.
7. Go to a folder in your file system and clone project from GitHub into this folder with command
   <br /><code>git clone https://github.com/p1q/ParseFile.git</code>
   <br /> By default the new subfolder "ParseFile" will be created inside.
8. To build the app, go to "ParseFile" subfolder and execute the command from there
   <br /><code>mvn compile</code>
   <br /> You should see "BUILD SUCCESS".
9. To run the app, execute the command
   <br /><code>mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.parsefile.Main"</code>
10. That's all! You should see the app menu now.

## :warning: Please Note
While coding some assumptions were made because of possible twofold understanding of some task details:
- Opened file doesn't include very special symbols. The file will be cleaned of this symbols:  .,?!:;()@#$%&^<>'
  but if it has something else, in that case the statistics can be inaccurate. 
- Shortest and longest words can be "".
- Two words with different letter case are considered as different words (e.g. "Sample" and "sample").
- Line length for the whole file is considered as sum of all its lines.
- FileParser class is covered by unit test (JUnit4).
- Google Java Style is followed while coding.

Of cause, it's possible to amend the application according to customer's requirements.
